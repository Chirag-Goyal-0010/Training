This section covers how Rails handles static assets like JavaScript, CSS, images, and fonts.

## Topics:

1.  **Introduction to the Asset Pipeline (Sprockets) / Propshaft:** Understanding how Rails processes assets (depending on the Rails version).
2.  **Organizing Assets:** Where to place your asset files.
3.  **Referencing Assets in Views:** Using helper methods to link to assets.
4.  **Precompiling Assets:** Preparing assets for production.
5.  **Using External Libraries:** Integrating CSS and JavaScript frameworks.

Each topic will have a `theory.md` for explanation, `syntax.md` for code examples, and an `examples` subdirectory for practical demonstrations.
