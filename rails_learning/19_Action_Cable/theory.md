# Action Cable Theory

## Introduction
Action Cable seamlessly integrates WebSockets with the rest of your Rails application. It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the same style and form as the rest of your Rails application, while still being performant and scalable.

## Key Concepts

### 1. WebSockets
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Persistent connection between client and server
- Lower latency than HTTP polling
- Full-duplex communication

### 2. Action Cable Components
- **Connection**: Establishes and maintains the WebSocket connection
- **Channel**: Routes messages between client and server
- **Subscription**: Client-side subscription to channels
- **Broadcasting**: Server-side message distribution

### 3. Connection Setup
```ruby
# app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user

    def connect
      self.current_user = find_verified_user
    end

    private
      def find_verified_user
        if verified_user = User.find_by(id: cookies.signed[:user_id])
          verified_user
        else
          reject_unauthorized_connection
        end
      end
  end
end
```

### 4. Channel Types
1. **Regular Channels**
   - Basic pub/sub functionality
   - Custom methods for specific actions

2. **Streaming Channels**
   - Automatic subscription to model updates
   - Real-time model synchronization

### 5. Broadcasting
- **Direct Broadcasting**: Send to specific channel
- **Model Broadcasting**: Automatic updates on model changes
- **Custom Broadcasting**: Custom logic for message distribution

### 6. Security
- Connection authentication
- Channel authorization
- Message filtering
- CSRF protection

### 7. Deployment Considerations
- Redis adapter for production
- Scaling strategies
- Load balancing
- Monitoring and logging

## Best Practices

### 1. Connection Management
- Proper authentication
- Connection lifecycle handling
- Error handling
- Reconnection strategies

### 2. Channel Organization
- Logical channel structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper separation of concerns
- Efficient message routing

### 3. Performance
- Message size optimization
- Connection pooling
- Resource cleanup
- Memory management

### 4. Testing
- Connection tests
- Channel tests
- Integration tests
- Load testing

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Real-time Chat
- Private messaging
- Group chat
- Presence indicators
- Typing indicators

### 2. Live Updates
- Notifications
- Activity feeds
- Real-time counters
- Status updates

### 3. Collaborative Features
- Live editing
- Shared cursors
- Real-time comments
- Synchronized views

### 4. Gaming
- Real-time game state
- Player interactions
- Score updates
- Game events

## Integration with Frontend

### 1. JavaScript Setup
```javascript
// app/javascript/channels/consumer.js
import consumer from "./consumer"

consumer.subscriptions.create("ChatChannel", {
  connected() {
    console.log("Connected to chat channel")
  },
  
  received(data) {
    console.log("Received message:", data)
  }
})
```

### 2. Channel Subscriptions
- Automatic reconnection
- Subscription management
- Message handling
- Error handling

### 3. UI Integration
- Real-time updates
- State management
- User feedback
- Error display

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Scaling
- Multiple servers
- Load balancing
- Redis clustering
- Message queuing

### 2. Monitoring
- Connection metrics
- Channel statistics
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Custom Adapters
- Custom backend storage
- Specialized protocols
- Integration with other systems
- Custom authentication

### 4. Security Measures
- Message encryption
- Rate limiting
- Access control
- Audit logging
