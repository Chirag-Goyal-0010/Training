# 10 - Helper Methods

This section explores helper methods in Rails, which are used to encapsulate reusable logic for views.

## Topics:

1.  **Introduction to Helpers:** What are helpers and why use them?
2.  **Built-in Helpers:** Common helpers provided by Rails (e.g., for text formatting, numbers, dates, links).
3.  **Custom Helpers:** Creating your own helper methods.
4.  **Helper Modules and Organization:** Structuring your helper code.

Each topic will have a `theory.md` for explanation, `syntax.md` for code examples, and an `examples` subdirectory for practical demonstrations.
