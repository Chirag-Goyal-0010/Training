# Introduction to Ruby

## What is Ruby?
Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Advantages of Ruby
1. **Concise and Elegant Code**
   - Small, elegant, and powerful codebase
   - Fewer lines of code required
   - Natural and readable syntax

2. **Web Development**
   - Simple and fast creation of web applications
   - Less hard work required
   - Great for rapid prototyping

3. **Open Source**
   - Free to copy, use, and modify
   - Allows programmers to make necessary changes
   - Strong community support

4. **Dynamic Language**
   - No strict rules on how to build features
   - Very close to spoken languages
   - Flexible and adaptable

## Disadvantages of Ruby
1. **Learning Curve**
   - Unique coding language
   - Takes time to master
   - Different from traditional languages

2. **Debugging**
   - Code is harder to debug
   - Most errors occur at runtime
   - Can be difficult to read while debugging

3. **Resources**
   - Fewer informational resources compared to other languages
   - Limited learning materials
   - Smaller community than some other languages

4. **Performance**
   - Interpreted scripting language
   - Slower than compiled languages
   - Not ideal for high-performance applications

## Getting Started
To start programming in Ruby, you'll need to:
1. Install Ruby on your system
2. Set up a development environment
3. Learn basic syntax and concepts
4. Practice with simple programs

## Basic Example
```ruby
# Simple Ruby program
puts "Hello, World!"

# Variables and basic math
age = 25
puts "I am #{age} years old"

# Basic input
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{name}!"
```
